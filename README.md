# square-root-calculator
A little program to calculate the square root using mathematics and not the built-in function in python math.sqrt()


Run the main.py file to start the program.

1. Lets say we would like to know the square root of number B.
2. Lets say A = sqrt(B).
3. If we choose any positive real number C and repeat step 4 many times, then number C will be very close to number A.
4. Decrease C by (C^2-B)/2C {C -= (C^2-B)/2C}
